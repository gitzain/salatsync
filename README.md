## Motivation
The motivation behind this project stemmed from a desire to streamline daily routines by having everything in one placeâ€”Google Calendar. Instead of relying on multiple apps or manual tracking for prayer times, I wanted a seamless integration that would automatically add prayer times to my existing calendar. This ensures that I never miss a prayer, while also keeping my schedule organized and consolidated in a single, convenient location.
